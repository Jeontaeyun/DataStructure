### Arithmetic Operators

Suppose that a is 10, b is 20, c is 3

| Operator | Description | Example       |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| +        | add         | a + b = 30    |
| -        | subtract    | a-b = -10     |
| \*       | multiply    | a\*b = 200    |
| /        | division    | b/a = 2.0     |
| %        | remainder   | b%a = 0       |
| \*\*     | power       | a\*\*c = 1000 |
| //       | quotient    | a//c = 3      |
